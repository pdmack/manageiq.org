        Getting started with RAD is as simple as following three
        steps. You'll be up and running in under 30 minutes.

          ### Step 1: **Download & deploy your appliance**

        - case deploy_type


          - when 'openstack'
            :markdown
              1.  Download RAD directly to OpenStack by running
                  this command:

                  ~~~bash
                  curl -O http://rad.redhat.com/download/rad-openstack-devel.qc2 && \
                  glance image-create --name "RAD-devel" \
                  --is-public True --disk-format qcow2 \
                  --container-format=bare --file rad-openstack-devel.qc2
                  ~~~

              2.  Launch a new instance from the RAD image. RAD needs a
                  minimum of 6GB RAM and a 45GB persistent disk, so choose or create
                  an instance flavor accordingly.


        :markdown
          ### Step 2: **First connection and configuration**

          1.  Log into the ManageIQ dashboard by connecting to the new running VM
              with a web browser.
              The initial username and password is `admin`/`smartvm`.

          2.  There are a number of basic settings, located under
              "Configure → Configuration" in the web interface, or under
              "Advanced Settings" in the VM's console, that you may wish to
              change when starting ManageIQ for the first time. Among the
              most common are:

              * Time and date settings
              * DHCP configuration
              * Hostname
              * Admin password


          ### Step 3: **Add an infrastructure or cloud provider**

          Now that your ManageIQ Appliance is up and running, it's time to connect up
          with your Providers (Cloud or Infrastructure) and gather data about them.

          .col-md-6
            :markdown
              #### Discover a new infrastructure provider

              For Microsoft SCVMM, RHEV, oVirt, or vSphere

              1. Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Providers**
              2. Click **Configuration** → **Discover**,
              3. Select the type
              4. Enter an IP Range

          .col-md-6
            :markdown
              #### Add a new cloud provider

              For OpenStack, Amazon EC2

              1. Navigate to **Clouds** → **Providers**
              2. Click **Configuration** → **Discover**
              3. Select the type
              4. Enter an IP Range

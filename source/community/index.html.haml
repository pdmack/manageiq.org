  ## Getting involved

  RAD is made by [a big team](team)---one that's growing larger
  with every contribution.

  There are several ways for everyone to participate, whether it's
  contributing knowledge and experience or proposing patches directly
  from your image. Here are some things you can do straight away to step
  up to the next level and help make RAD better for everyone.

      ## Governance and licensing

      The RAD project is a meritocracy. We practice open and transparent
      planning and development. As a project participant, you get a say in the
      features we will prioritize in future versions, you can see feature
      planning and code contributions [as they
      happen](http://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq), and you can propose your
      own changes via [pull requests](patches).

      We want the RAD community to be a nice place to hang out and we
      expect community members to treat each other with courtesy and respect.
      Please familiarize yourself with our
      [community guidelines](community-guidelines).

      All code contributed to the core of the project is contributed under a
      dual license: GPL v2 and Apache License v2. To understand why, and for
      more information on licensing and governance of RAD, please read
      the [RAD Licensing FAQ](licensing-faq).

      *[meritocracy]: a group based on individuals' achievements
